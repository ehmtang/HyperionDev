1. An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

"""
request positive integer from the user

while positive integer is not zero or null

	make a list of requested positive integers

	request another positive integer from the user

else
	
	print max value of positive integers from list
"""


2. An algorithm that reads an arbitary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

"""
get array

	total = sum of integers
	
	average = total / length of array

	return average
	
"""


3. An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products in alphabetical order that are still left to buy.

"""
get shopping list, items_in_basket

	for each item in items_in_basket
	
		if items_in_basket is in shopping list
		
			remove that item from the shopping list
	
	sort items in shopping list by ascending order
	
	print items in shopping list
"""


4. See flow chart

"""
get X, Y

let S = X + Y

let A = S / 2

let P = X * Y

return S, A, P
